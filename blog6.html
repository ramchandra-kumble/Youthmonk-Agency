									<p>What is content writing? It is a process of planning, writing, and editing web content, typically for digital
                                        marketing purposes. It includes writing blogs, articles and scripts for videos.
                                    </p><p>The most important thing I’ve learned from content writing is choosing the right words, and the
                                        importance of great content. Good content highly drives marketing in almost every aspect. While good
                                        content brings followers, great content generates higher conversion rates. Other than this it helped me
                                        with a lot of knowledge about Research, time management, choosing right words, editing, communication
                                        skills, SEO, originality, SMO, copywriting, knowledge of social media and a lot more…</p><p>
                                        There is also one thing I realized that no matter how much efforts you put in, some writers are better than
                                        others. What makes these writers better is the difference of how they research and function to make their
                                        content exceptional.</p><p>
                                        In this digital era, where there are number of content websites, only writing what is on your mind is not
                                        enough, pairing your talent with the right way of processing is all what is takes to make the content
                                        remarkably good.</p>
                                        <h3>Some tips of writing content are:</h3>
									<ul>
										
										
										<li>Do a lot of research: Research adds validity to your content. Your readers will not want to
                                            read something that has been written out of speculations. By thoroughly researching the
                                            proper sources of information , you will increase the quality of your content as research
                                            also helps to improve the knowledge of the content writer.</li>
                                            <li>
                                             Skills of content writer: getting into someone else’s shoes and writing exactly in the same
                                            way is now how you should start your content or to make it. There are some writers who
                                            have a unique way of writing; you should always take inspiration from them and not to
                                            just simply copying their style as the WRITING STYLE IS THE IDENTITY OF THE
                                            WRITER.
                                        </li><li> Create a killer title and first paragraph: Giving a good title to your content is very
                                            important in content making as the title attracts peoples’ attention at first sight followed
                                            by the first paragraph. They will only be interested in reading the rest of the article only if
                                            they will find these two interesting.
                                            </li><li> Content should not be exaggerated and kept simple: while creating content it should be
                                            taken care that the content should not be exaggerated as most of the people may not be
                                            able to understand your complex sentence structure and vocabulary. When you write,
                                            keep the audience in mind and try to write simple. Even a child should be able to
                                            understand what you are trying to convey.
                                            </li><li> on your work: writing wants deep focus from your end, which at times is hard
                                            to have.
                                            </li><li> Have a solid understanding and latest updates of SEO: You must have regular updates for
                                            online promotions all the time you write so that you must go with the trend. Create SEO
                                            friendly description and title, use your keyboard effectually and always keep an eye on
                                            latest algorithms changed by Google.
                                            </li><li> Prepare yourself to meet deadlines: There is indeed some deadline that you must set or
                                            must be always having. Delivering good content on time shows how professional and
                                            good you are n your work, it shows that you are someone who can be relied on. If you find
                                            yourself stressed with work then probably you must be overloaded woith a lot of work. If
                                            you complete your task them you must have time to proof your article and a brief
                                            grammar check is very necessary before handing over your work.
                                            </li><li> Focus on single purpose: You must find at least one key message that you want to convey
                                            through your content. Keep this in mind while writing and tie your content to the focus
                                            point as much as possible.
                                            </li><li> Write in unique voice: You should always keep one thing in mind that the content you
                                            publish in the voice of your company reflects the image of your company.
                                            </li><li> Use digital content: The best digital content often consist of short paragraphs, short
                                            sentences and bulleted lists.
                                            </li><li> Edit your work: After creating the first draft, go back and check how much rough edges
                                            you need to polish in your writing. It is a fact that writing of a person improves as it goes
                                            through two or three rounds of edits (even in the case of highly experienced content
                                            creators).
                                        </li><li> As soon as you get an idea, jot down the ways you could develop it.
                                        </li><li> Depth and length of your content should always match. There are 2 things that make
                                            writing difficult to read. One is not giving enough detail and just covering the spotty ideas.
                                            The other one is giving too much of details which is not needed. So the writer must ensure
                                            not to make any of these.</li>
											
									</ul>
                                    <p>These were some of the things I learned till now for being a good content maker</p>
