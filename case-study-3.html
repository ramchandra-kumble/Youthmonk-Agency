                    <h2>Problems: </h2>
                    <p>There were several challenges that we’re not letting our client grow like: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Company's website wasn't visible in the top 3 on Google search engine so their Clients were
                            facing difficulty in finding their website </li>

                        <li>Due to this, it was hindering their lead generation and not many people were aware about
                            this due to lack of social media engagement </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The above-mentioned challenges are the most important criteria that help a website rank on
                        Google. </p>

                    <hr>


                    <h2>Execution: </h2>
                    <p>We reviewed their website technicalities and came up with unique solutions to optimize the
                        on-page and
                        off-page factors in SEO, social media and development of their services through digital
                        concepts.</p>
                    <p>We performed a detailed baseline examination and identified which things were correct and were
                        showing good results.</p>
                    <p>We also led a SEO audit and keyword research on vertical farming and accordingly created an
                        implementation plan that were expected to have measurable results.</p>

                    <p>The main purpose of making the audit was to identify the issues which were made during the
                        initial stage of the website which were influencing search performance.</p>

                    <h2>Things a Customer-focused Website has:</h2>
                    <ol><h4>Design</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Website was designed poorly in terms of user friendliness and no marketing
                                element was added to capture leads.</li>
                            <li>For this, we tried to understand the customer’s online behavior which gave us an
                                insight into which things were giving a good result.</li>
                            <li>We checked and worked on these parameters. • The links and buttons should be
                                clickable.</li>
                            <li>The website was developed with new features which increased the lead generation
                                according to the plan. The website was designed in such a way that was easy to
                                navigate, and easy to comprehend.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Speed</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The website speed was poor & there were a lot of technical errors on the website
                                which lowered the rank of the website.</li>
                            <li>If the website speed is slow, the conversion rates are less. • Faster sites create happy
                                users and it’s a human tendency to leave the site when the speed is slow.</li>
                            <li>Therefore, to enhance the speed we optimized the website and made the
                                necessary changes.</li>
                            <li>Optimization of the website increased the conversion rates.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Content</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The content on the site was too less.</li>
                            <li>The website will only appear in search engine when the content is relevant to the
                                website’s purpose.</li>
                            <li>Content is essential, not only for keywords and page rankings, but it should also
                                help the consumer with the detailed information of the consumer’s interest.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Backlink Analysis:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>After the On-Page SEO was setup, we did the backlink analysis.</li>
                        <li>Back link analysis gave us a better understanding of the web site's ability to rank well in search engine results and we could also identify undesirable links.</li>
                        <li>As per the analysis the backlink profile was not working fine.</li>
                        <li>We acquired backlinks from High Authority DA & PA sites and made it work successfully.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Social Media Marketing:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The company had accounts on Facebook and Instagram but still needed to make account on Twitter and LinkedIn</li>
                        <li>The accounts need to have more structured data.</li>
                        <li>To know the audience and their choices, the company needed to stay active on almost all the social media platforms.</li>
                        <li>Also to get consistent in uploading various posts on your Instagram page, using more hashtags would help to reach more people.</li>

                        <li>Added videos and more photos to your webpages related to the company’s content.</li>
                        <li>Started answering the queries more and tried guest blogging on the webpage.</li>
                        <li>Stayed active on social media by posting impressive content to get to the right audience</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Results: </h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We were able to observe significant SEO results in just 90 days once enough backlinks were
                            crawled by Google. </li>
                        <li>The primary keywords ranked on Google’s 1st page and the leads and enquiries started to
                            generate from the website organically.</li>
                        <li>The number of leads increased by 1000% & Organic traffic increased by 300% in the next two
                            months.</li>
                        <li>Through social media engagement, we were able to reach a lot of new people, who weren’t
                            aware about the company.</li>
                        <li>Thus, social media helped to reach maximum no of people and still playing an important role
                            to increase the reach.</li>
