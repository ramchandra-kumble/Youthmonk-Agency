									<p>In the world of Search Engine Optimization, trends tend to change with time. And there are a lot of SEO
                                    tips out there. Let us know about some of the important ones:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<h3>Creating content around Primary and Secondary Keywords:
                                            </h3>
											<p>Keyword research is at the core of every effective keyword strategy. Both Primary and Secondary
                                                keywords are used in the formation of a great content and knowing how to use them will definitely
                                                lead searchers to the website. Primary Keyword should always be the main focus of your leading
                                                page. It should contain a strong description of what your page is about and what your brand does.
                                                These primary keywords should be the main focus of the whole content. <br>Secondary keywords are supporting words which are related to the primary keywords. By using
                                                secondary keywords, you will increase the ranking of your website.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h3>Remove things that loads slowly:
                                            </h3>
											<p>You should know that your page time affects your SEO. These pages have higher bounce rates. It
                                                is obvious that the longer it will take to load the page, the less time the visitors will spend on your
                                                page. You should always check the speed of your site. Always remember to review your website.
                                                Check if any elements are there which are dragging down the load time, like any unnecessary
                                                plug-in? Remove or restructure them and you will likely observe an increase in the traffic on your
                                                website.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h3>Always publish the original work/content:</h3>
											<p>When you add new pages to your website, it is very important to make sure that you are pulling
                                                the original content and avoiding the duplicate one. Especially if there is a presence of heavy
                                                blogging in your industry, it would be more preferable to do it in rankings.<br>
                                                Search Engine Algorithms, particularly Google, are specially designed to sniff out the content
                                                which is unique. It is believed that those who publish the original content and are good in
                                                practicing SEO are most likely to turn up higher in search list. In the past, there were a few
                                                websites which were removed from search engine lists for plagiarizing their content. So
                                                originality is always the key!</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h3>Make sure that your content is evergreen:</h3>
											<p>For any inbound marketing strategy, EVERGREEN is the best gift which always keeps on giving.
                                                This content is meant to stand the test of time. You should make sure that your content should be
                                                relevant today as well as 5 years from today. This helps to bring traffic on your website
                                                continuously over the time and helps in bringing more visitors to your page.<br>
                                                While creating evergreen content, have an idea about what things will help to retain its long term
                                                value to the readers. Always try to remove things like breaking news or any timely news, anything
                                                which involves data that is meant to change over time, seasonal content, pop culture news and
                                                fashion news.</p>

											<p>As we know that trends on social media keeps on changing just like that, SEO trends also keeps on

                                                </p>

											<h3>Format your content for search engines:</h3>
											<p>Another thing which really matters is how you use your words and how you format your content.
                                                You must ensure that your content is as more informative as it can be. One the other hand it is also
                                                very important to make sure that it is easy to understand, friendly for readers, and in the right
                                                format. Generally, length of sentences should not be more than 20 words. And while there should
                                                not just be a single paragraph, it is also important to check that the other paragraphs are not too
                                                long.</p>
										</li>
										<li>
											<h3>Increase your word count:</h3>
											<p>It is very important to make sure that the content you are writing is comprehensive. It has a major
                                                role as it helps people to understand what your content is actually about and if they have any
                                                questions in their minds, they can find their answers in the content itself. At the same time you
                                                must ensure that your content is not too long. Higher word count also allows you to add more
                                                keywords.</p>
